Public Names - Protocol
====================

    There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. 
    -- Phil Karlton

We articulate texts to name things, peoples, emotions and other ideas.

And we put a lot of meaning in those articulations. 

Public Names is a protocol to distribute uniform text articulations between computer programs.

# Applications

Public Names is a better way of naming things because it conveys the original articulation.

Computers can map articulations in a convergent graph of texts to assist their users with relevant informations.

Users can share how they articulate texts to name things via their computers.

# Specifications

Public Names is defined by its JavaScript reference implementation.

# Requirements

Public Names is a text protocol, its implementation requires support of Unicode text strings.
